# Team
Building a Global Team of Opensource Developers.

**Team** is the team of people who supports opensource development. If you're one of them, join us as a [Team member](https://github.com/socialat/team/issues/new?template=support-request.md). We all together can help others to grow their open source projects.

*Team* is the place where people can find you, discuss with you, and ask you to support their open source project.

## How does it work
When someone raises an issue to [get support](https://github.com/socialat/team/issues/new?template=support-request.md), all the members of the team mentioned in the issue will be notified automatically. Someone from the team can claim to handle that issue.
